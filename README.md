# RelativeDimensionsPromo

Here are two example projects I worked on whilst at Relative Dimensions.

A short example of our motion capture to in-game animation software running in real time. This allows up to 10 actors at once (provided you have the space) to translate their movements from real world to game engine, and are able to see each other within the space.

A promotional video created to show off the Doctor Who experience we developed for the BBC. I worked on the menu system, some game logic, and the rendering of the TARDIS portal in VR (including rendering correctly for each eye).
