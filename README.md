# RelativeDimensionsPromo

Here are two example projects I worked on whilst at Relative Dimensions.

The example VR experience that we built at Relative Dimensions. It allowed users to experience the London Bridge back in the 1600s, with authentic-looking buildings, actors and sound effects. This project was modified to show to the BBC, Siemens, and other companies.

A (very short) example of our motion capture to in-game animation software running in real time. This allows up to 10 actors at once (provided you have the space) to translate their movements from real world to game engine, and are able to see each other within the space.
